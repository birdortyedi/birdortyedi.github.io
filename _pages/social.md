Hello folks!

My name is Furkan Kınlı. I was born on April of 1993 in Aydın, Turkey. I came to İstanbul for educational purposes.

I was eligible to attend Özyeğin University with 75% of YÖK scholarship and 25% of sports scholarship for B.Sc. degree. 
In August 2019, I received M. Sc. degree in Computer Science at Özyeğin University, and during my M.Sc. study, I initially lead my research focus to fashion image understanding and capsule networks and its applications. 
After my graduation, I have been accepted to the Ph.D. in Computer Science at Özyeğin University for 2019 Spring (Yes, triple crown!). Now, I am working on style modeling for image restoration tasks.

I prefer that being an academician/a scientist who contributes to Computer Science in such a way for prospering the community's welfare rather than being a developer who works for prospering someone's welfare.

In my social life;

I have a friend, named "Alex". I got inspired by Alex de Souza (ofc!).

I am a fan of basketball, especially NBA. Go NOLA!

I am really mad on Eurovision Song Contest. I follow the contest, songs and magazine on it for every year. I follow huge ESC playlists on Spotify. 

Playlists | [2020][link_20] | [2019][link_19] | [2018][link_18] | [2017][link_17] | [2016][link_16] | [2015 and older][link_15]

I was individual-licensed player for Billiards and also, I was the instructor of two Billiards courses at Özyeğin University. Snooker and Neil Robertson have something special for me and I pursue them sensually.
