**Looking for the opportunities for Research Internship or Visiting Researcher positions.**

### About Me

*   I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Computer Science Department][ozu-cs] at [Özyeğin University][ozu],
advised by [Asst. Prof. Furkan Kıraç][fkirac].

*   I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in [Özyeğin University][ozu], (YES, Triple crown!).

*   My research interests focus on image restoration, camera pipeline, illuminance and colors and computational photography. Previously, I have worked on the downstream applications of computer vision, particularly using deep learning approaches, as well as the applications of generative modeling, image-to-image translation, fashion image understanding and capsule networks.
